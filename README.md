# TrustForge
TrustForge is an autonomous AI engine that transforms natural language into multi-step, verifiable workflows. By bridging the gap between LLM reasoning and real-world execution, we move beyond "chatting" to a system that actually does the work.

# Problem
Manual Friction: Humans must manually bridge data between disconnected apps (SaaS, Databases, APIs).

Static AI: Most AI tools can only talk; they lack the autonomy to perform sequences of actions.

Trust Deficit: No transparent record exists to prove why an AI performed a specific sensitive action.

# Solution 
Our project bridges the gap between AI "chatting" and AI "doing" by creating a Verifiable Agentic Workforce.

Autonomous Reasoning: Powered by the Weilliptic SDK, the agent breaks down high-level goals into logical, multi-step execution plans without human guidance.

Universal Tool Access: Uses the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to interact with any database (CockroachDB) or app (Slack/Gmail) via a standardized, plug-and-play interface.

Immutable Trust: Every agent decision and action is anchored on-chain, providing a tamper-proof audit trail that proves exactly why and how a task was completed.

Real-time Transparency: The Icarus Platform visualizes the agent's thought process live, turning "Black Box" AI into a transparent, observable workflow.

# Tech Stack
Frontend: Next.js / Tailwind CSS (Dashboard & Chat UI).

Backend: Node.js / TypeScript (Service orchestration).

AI/ML: Weilliptic SDK (Agentic logic) + Gemini 3 (Reasoning).

Protocol: Model Context Protocol (MCP) (Standardized tool-calling).

Database: CockroachDB (Distributed data storage).

Infrastructure: Icarus Platform (Deployment & Visualization).

Trust Layer: WeilChain (On-chain audit logging).

# Key Features
1.Autonomous Intent Planning: Uses the Weilliptic SDK to decompose complex natural language into logical, multi-step execution chains without human intervention.

2.Plug-and-Play Interoperability: Leverages MCP (Model Context Protocol) to instantly connect and command diverse tools like CockroachDB, Slack, and GitHub through a unified interface.

3.Verifiable On-Chain Audits: Anchors every agent "thought" and API action to the blockchain, creating a tamper-proof, transparent record of the entire workflow.
